		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This project was inspired by my love of music and my daily exposure to new genres. When I'm working or relaxing, I always need some music to keep me going. Music is peaceful and lovely, so when I discover new music or songs I've never heard before, I get excited because I can enter that artist's world while listening to the beats and words. I have always been and will continue to be a music lover, so I created this project for others who share my passion.</p>
